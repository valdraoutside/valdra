### About Us
**Header:** Welcome to VALDRA Outside  

**Body:**  
Hi! We’re Lilla & Katie, best buds who started VALDRA after too many hikes with busted gear and not enough products that could actually keep up.  

The idea first sparked while trekking through the Himalayas last April. Carrying everything we needed on our backs, we realized just how much gear fails when you actually need it. We wanted something better.  

So we made it.  

VALDRA is for people who get outside and go for it—people who move, explore, get a little scraped up, and come back for more. Whether scrambling up peaks or navigating city streets, there’s a place for you here.  

Prototyping is underway, and we’re in manufacturer conversations to bring our first product to life. Launch: **mid-2026**.  

We’re building a brand that grows with our community. If you’re reading this, you’re already part of it.  

Much love to our Western Slope peeps. Reach out if you want to get involved. <3  

*Let’s get out there,*  
**Lilla & Katie**

### FAQ

**Q: What is VALDRA?**  
A: At the moment, we’re a budding outdoor community rooted in Telluride, Colorado. We aim to connect adventurers globally. In mid-2026, we’ll launch a semi-reusable first-aid apparatus we believe belongs in every dopp kit—outdoorsperson or not. Currently, we’re deep in manufacturing and prototyping.  

**Q: Why are you being secretive about the product?**  
A: We’re in an early prototyping stage where every small decision matters. By keeping details quiet, we protect the innovation, ensure proper testing, and give the launch its best chance to succeed. The secrecy isn’t hype—it’s integrity. You’ll be the first to know when it’s ready.  

**Q: Can I get involved?**  
A: Absolutely. Right now, involvement looks like joining our community, showing up to events, and connecting with others who love the outdoors. As launch approaches, we’ll seek testers, early adopters, and advocates. Stay close, stay curious, and raise your hand when opportunities pop up.  

**Q: Does VALDRA have a mission beyond this product?**  
A: Yes. Our mission is to build a lasting outdoor community rooted in connection, resilience, and innovation. We aim to design affordable, durable gear that empowers people to stay out longer and access inspiring outdoor spaces. We also plan to pursue B Corp certification, holding ourselves to high environmental and social standards. At its core, VALDRA is about more than equipment—it’s about inspiring people to share in the adventure.
